    <h2>E-Commerce and M-Commerce</h2>
<p>E-commerce refers to the buying and selling of goods and services through digital platforms, enabling transactions to occur beyond geographical and time constraints. Over the past decade, the proliferation of internet access, secure digital payment systems, and improved logistics infrastructure has driven exponential growth in online shopping.</p>

<p>In India, platforms such as Flipkart, Amazon, and others have revolutionized consumer behavior by offering extensive product assortments, competitive pricing, and convenient doorstep delivery. Flipkart’s market penetration strategies, including regional language support and cash-on-delivery options, have made online shopping accessible to semi-urban and rural populations. Similarly, Amazon has leveraged global supply chain expertise, advanced recommendation algorithms, and subscription models like Amazon Prime to enhance customer loyalty.</p>

<p>The rise of other niche and specialized e-commerce platforms—ranging from Myntra in fashion to BigBasket in groceries—has further diversified the market. The sector’s evolution reflects a shift from transactional convenience to experiential engagement, with personalized recommendations, AI-driven customer support, and omnichannel integration redefining how consumers interact with brands.</p>
