    <h2>Cybersecurity in Digital Commerce</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity in digital commerce involves the protection of online transactions, customer data, and digital infrastructure from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyberattacks. As e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, and cloud-based operations expand, businesses face heightened risks including phishing, ransomware, identity theft, and data breaches.</p>

<p>Robust cybersecurity strategies integrate encryption, multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, and continuous network monitoring to safeguard sensitive information. Compliance with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS) is essential for legal and ethical operations.</p>

<p>In the context of digital commerce, cybersecurity is not merely a technical safeguard but a trust enabler, directly influencing customer confidence, brand reputation, and long-term market competitiveness. Proactive investment in threat intelligence, incident response, and employee training is vital to mitigate evolving cyber risks in an increasingly interconnected global marketplace.</p>
