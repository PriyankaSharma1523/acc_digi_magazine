    <h2>Digital Commerce and Sustainability</h2>
    <p>Digital commerce and sustainability intersect in the pursuit of environmentally responsible, socially equitable, and economically viable business practices within online trade. By reducing the need for physical retail infrastructure, optimizing supply chains, and enabling paperless transactions, digital commerce can lower carbon footprints and resource consumption.</p>

<p>Sustainability in digital commerce extends beyond environmental benefits, encompassing ethical sourcing, fair labor practices, and inclusive access to digital marketplaces. Technological innovations such as AI-driven demand forecasting, blockchain-based supply chain transparency, and green logistics solutions further align e-commerce operations with sustainable development goals.</p>

<p>However, challenges persist, including increased energy consumption from data centers, packaging waste from online deliveries, and the carbon impact of global shipping. Balancing growth in digital commerce with sustainability requires strategic integration of eco-friendly practices, stakeholder collaboration, and compliance with evolving environmental regulations.</p>
